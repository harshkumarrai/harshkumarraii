# Hi, I'm Harsh 👋

⚡ Ethereum / Smart Contract Developer  
🔐 Specialized in secure, upgradeable Solidity systems and contract testing

---

## 🧠 Profile
Ethereum-focused developer with hands-on experience building and testing
**production-style smart contracts**. Strong understanding of **EVM internals,
contract upgradability, proxy architectures, and storage safety**.

Comfortable working with real-world constraints such as immutability, upgrades,
access control, and failure handling.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Expertise

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity** — ERC20, staking, access control, upgradeable contracts
- **EVM Internals** — `delegatecall`, storage layout, calldata & execution context
- **Proxy Architectures** — Transparent Proxy, fallback routing, upgrade flows

### Testing & Tooling
- **Foundry** — unit testing, debugging, gas inspection, deployment workflows
- Test-driven approach for contract correctness and upgrade safety

### Backend & Integration
- **Ethereum RPC** — transaction lifecycle, read/write interactions
- **Node.js / TypeScript** — basic backend integration
- **Redis, Pub/Sub, Queues** — async workflows & event-driven systems

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Ethereum Smart Contract Suite
A collection of production-oriented Ethereum contracts including:
- Upgradeable **ERC20 (OrcaCoin)** implementation
- **Staking contracts** with reward logic
- Proxy-based upgrade mechanisms using `delegatecall`
- Comprehensive test coverage using Foundry

Focus areas:
- Safe contract upgrades
- Storage collision prevention
- Access-controlled upgrade flows
- Debugging & fixing deployed logic without redeploying state

---

## 🧪 Engineering Principles
- Security-first contract design
- Clear separation of storage & logic
- Test coverage before upgrades
- Production-minded architecture decisions
